    <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>PoseCap is intended for use by individuals above the age of 4. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 4 years of age. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 4, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
